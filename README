Acme-MobileTradeFun

I recently found a site called MobileTradeFun (or MobaTreFun for short), where
people can search the value of cards from mobile games, such as idolmaster.

http://mobile-trade.jp

This site seems to contain the "official" card images as they show up on the
mobile devices in Japan.  This module basically lets you specify a game, and
scrapes all the high quality cards off the site.

Note that card names are stored in Japanese, as each card contains certain
attributes such as category, card name and rarity.  Without these attributes,
cards cannot be identified uniquely.

The interface of the module is pretty simple.  You construct a hashref of args,
and pass it onto the class method run() which will take the rest.

    use Acme::MobileTradeFun;

    my $args = {
        game        => 'idolmaster',
        parallel    => 10,
    };

    my $foo = Acme::MobileTradeFun->run( $args );
    
Here are the overwritable defaults in the hashref.  Currently 4 games are
supported: bahamut, idolmaster, saintseiya and gangroad.

    game        => '',
    base_url    => 'http://mobile-trade.jp/fun',
    php_script  => 'card.php',
    row         => 100,     # how many cards per page
    page        => 1,       # which page to start from
    output_dir  => '/tmp',  # where to save the images
    debug       => 0,
